# Neural Network - Self Driving Car 

This repository contains the code for a Self-driving car implemented without the use of external libraries, entirely written in JavaScript.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a neural network-based model for autonomous navigation in a simulated environment. The neural network is trained to make decisions and control the movements of the car, allowing it to navigate through various scenarios.

## Features

- **Neural Network Implementation:** The self-driving car is powered by a neural network designed to analyze input data and make decisions based on the learned patterns.

- **JavaScript Implementation:** The entire codebase is written in JavaScript, making it accessible and easy to understand. This project serves as an educational resource for those interested in neural networks and self-driving car technology.

- **Simulation Environment:** The self-driving car operates in a simulated environment, providing a controlled setting for training and testing the neural network.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the self-driving car simulation up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/self-driving-car.git
```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd self-driving-car
   ```

3. **Open the Simulation:**
- Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start the simulation.

4. **Explore the Code:**
- Take a look at the JavaScript code in the `src` directory to understand the implementation of the neural network and the self-driving car logic.

## Dependencies

This project is built without relying on external libraries. The neural network and simulation are implemented from scratch using JavaScript, showcasing the core concepts of self-driving car technology.
